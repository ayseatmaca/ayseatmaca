# 👋 Hi, I’m Ayşe Atmaca (@ayseatmaca)

🚀 Double major explorer in **Aerospace Engineering (3rd year)** & **Software Engineering (2nd year)**.  
💡 Currently diving deep into **artificial intelligence, data science, and computational simulations** — basically mixing rockets with algorithms! 🚀🤖  

🌟 **GPA:** Aerospace - 3.38 | Software - 3.18  

---

## 👀 I’m interested in:
- ✈️ Aircraft materials & aerospace systems  
- 🤖 AI & data science adventures  
- 🐍 Python projects (SQLite, Pandas, Scikit-learn)  
- 🛠️ Engineering simulations (Ansys Fluent – flow analysis, SolidWorks – CAD/3D modeling, MATLAB)  
- ⚙️ Real-world automation & engineering solutions  

---

## 🌱 I’m currently learning:
- 📊 Data science & machine learning (bootcamps + hands-on projects)  
- 🧩 Data structures & algorithms (because coding needs strong foundations!)  
- 💾 Database stuff with SQLite  
- 🔬 Numerical methods (Finite Difference & Finite Element in MATLAB)  
- 🖊️ 3D modeling & CAD with SolidWorks  
- 🌊 Flow & multiphysics simulations with Ansys Fluent  

---

## 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
- 🔬 **TÜBİTAK 2209** or academic research projects  
- 🚀 Fun projects blending **AI + aerospace**  
- 💡 Anything where engineering meets code!
